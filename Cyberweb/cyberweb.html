            Would you allow me to take you on this long scroll with me?
        My name is Amanda, short for The Amazing Amanda.
        There is nothing short about this scroll though.
        But this is my way of walking you through my reading response.
        Do you remember what our reading response is about?
        More importantly, do you remember the terms and conditions that Morgan set?
        The terms and conditions are very important and we need to read through every
        single one of them and I'm going to need you to agree to every single term and condition
        if you want to keep reading my reading response.
        So let's get back to it. What were Morgan's terms and conditions? 
        First he told us to read Critical Atlas of the Internet by Louise Drulhe. Then he said,
        As you read, make note of passages you want to talk about, questions that come up, words/terms that need clarification or further discussion, and associations. 
        Third, Create a single web page by hand using any HTML / CSS / Javascript you know. Your web page should feature your name and respond to the reading in content and/or form (meaning, you can have a written reading response as your content but you can also respond through a design).
        There are apparently no expectations that we know how to do any of this. Make your web page available online.
        Don't spend more than 2 hours on this. 
        So now let's get to the response.
        Here is a quote that I really liked, which is also obviously my sneaky way to create some meta sense of this long scroll.
        "Reticular concentration
        In a reticular space, activity increases without the space getting physically bigger"
        I suppose that's what I'm doing right now. Or is it? 
        I know that the activity has increased in a quantitative sense but the space has not changed. 
        There is only velocity in the same space you've been scrolling.</div>
